# reinforcement


Here is the note of RL class.

Hw1: Rabbit farm.
<br>To make you be familiar with python and its libraries.<br/>

Hw2: Value Function using matrix approach. 
<br>Numpy is a good tools for solving matrix computing problems.<br/>

Hw3: Value Function & optimal policy using iterative DP method.<br/>
<br>Getting to know more about RL with "Values" & "Policy".

Hw4: Monte Carlo with Cat-Mouse environment. 
 Testing environments with Cat-Mouse envs with our First real RL method "Monte Carlo".

Hw5: Q-Learning with Cat-Mouse env. 
 A "model free" method, computing "Q(S,A)" without building the States as last homework.

Hw6: Sarsa & Expected Sarsa with epsilon greedy policy. 
 Sarsa is a little bit more conservative strategy with more exploring state while implementing "Epsilon Decay".

Hw7: Pytorch & CNN. 
 An overview with CNN models & pytorch API.

Hw8: Semi-gradient TD(0) with NN function approximation. 
 Cat-Mouse env again! Learning our "Values" & "Policy" with NN model. Interesting.

Hw9: Q-Learning with NN && Acrobot environment. 
 Off-policy Q-Learning sometimes causes "Dead Triad". How do we solve it?
